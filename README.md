# What? A new file that says "score.txt" has shown up
This is a "save file" as it contains your score and fails.

Make sure you have Python 3.10 **and** pygame installed.
Install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install Pygame: https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
To install pygame, type **pip install pygame** into the command prompt
# I have a Mac and/or Linux computer. What is "command prompt"?
Just use the terminal
# I still can't get it to work. What do I do?
